Travelling Salesmen Problem solved using Genetic Algorithm

## Description
This project aims at solving the travelling salesmen problem for a set of cities. The program uses genetic algorithm to solve the problem. The program also provides a grapical representation of the solution to the problem with the help of pygame library helping the user to easily visualise the route and its process.

## Prerequisites
Basic idea of the Travelling Salesmen Problem.
Basics of Genetic Algorithm.
Usage of python3 and PyGame library.

## Installing
